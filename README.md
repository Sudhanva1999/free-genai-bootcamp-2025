# Multi-Modal AI Language Portal for Marathi

A comprehensive multi-service language learning platform designed specifically for Marathi learners. This application integrates multiple specialized components to provide a complete language learning experience through vocabulary practice, listening comprehension, writing exercises, interactive study tools, and song-based learning.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of several interconnected services, each handling a specific aspect of language learning:

## Services

### 1. [Word Groups API / Vocab-Backend](./vocab-backend/README.md)
A Flask-based backend service that provides word groups and their translations in Marathi.
- Checks local SQLite database for words
- Falls back to Amazon Bedrock LLM when needed
- RESTful API for retrieving words by group ID or name

### 2. [Marathi Writing Practice App](./writing-comp/README.md)
An interactive application for writing practice and sentence generation.
- Word selection from different categories
- Sentence generation with Marathi and English translations
- Translation practice with text input, drawing, or image upload
- Grading and feedback system
- Integration with Amazon Bedrock for language processing

### 3. [Marathi Listening Practice](./listening-comp/README.md)
A comprehensive application for practicing Marathi listening comprehension.
- Question generation via AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Audio generation using Google Cloud TTS with Marathi voice models
- Practice types include dialogues and phrase matching
- Interactive feedback for answers
- Vector search using ChromaDB for context-aware generation

### 4. [Language Portal Frontend](./lang-portal/README.md)
A React-based single-page application for organizing the learning experience.
- Dashboard with statistics and study progress tracking
- Words management with extensive metadata
- Organization of words into logical groups
- Various study activity types (flashcards, quizzes, etc.)
- Study session tracking and performance analytics

### 5. [Marathi Song Vocabulary Agent](./song-vocab/README.md)
A specialized application that finds Marathi song lyrics, extracts vocabulary, and creates learning resources.
- Searches for and retrieves Marathi song lyrics from the web
- Extracts vocabulary with phonetic transcriptions and English meanings
- Saves structured data for language learning
- Flexible integration with local Ollama models or cloud-based AWS Bedrock models
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent architecture for coordinated processing

## AI/ML Integration

### Agentic AI in Language Learning

Leveraging Agentic AI for Dynamic Language Processing

Certain components of the platform incorporate Agentic AI, where autonomous AI-driven agents handle complex tasks through iterative reasoning and decision-making. This approach allows for more dynamic, context-aware language learning experiences.

1. **Song Vocabulary Agent**:
    - Uses a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Agent Architecture to autonomously fetch, analyze, and extract useful vocabulary from Marathi songs.

    - Retrieves Marathi song lyrics from the web using Search API integrations.

    - Employs LLM-based reasoning (Claude 3.5 Sonnet via AWS Bedrock or Ollama local models) to:

    - Parse and segment song lyrics.

    - Identify important vocabulary words.

    - Generate phonetic transcriptions and contextual translations.

    - Dynamically adjusts its approach based on the complexity of lyrics and user study preferences.

**Benefits of Agentic AI Integration**

- **Self-improving learning loops**: The AI adapts based on prior interactions, ensuring increasingly personalized study material.

- **Efficient resource utilization**: Local Ollama models offer offline processing, reducing cloud dependency.

- **Scalability**: New language learning activities can be added by extending the AI agentâ€™s reasoning capabilities.

### Amazon Bedrock Integration
The platform leverages Amazon Bedrock for advanced language processing capabilities across multiple services:

1. **Word Groups API**: Uses Claude model to generate Marathi word translations when not found in the database.
2. **Marathi Practice App**: Integrates with Bedrock for sentence generation and translation grading.
3. **Listening Practice**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet model to generate contextually relevant practice questions.
4. **Song Vocabulary Agent**: Leverages Claude 3.5 Sonnet for lyrics analysis and vocabulary extraction when in cloud mode.

Configuration:
```yaml
amazon_bedrock:
  api_endpoint: "https://api.amazonbedrock.com"
  api_key: "your_api_key_here"
  model_id: "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
  region: "us-east-1"
```

### Google Cloud TTS Integration
The Listening Practice module uses Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for generating native-sounding Marathi audio:

- Supports both male and female Marathi voices
- Handles speaker gender assignment
- Manages audio file concatenation using ffmpeg
- Creates appropriate pauses between speech segments

### Ollama Integration
The Song Vocabulary Agent can use local Ollama models for offline processing:

- Default model: `mistral`
- Configurable via environment variable
- Context window calculated based on available RAM
- Suitable for development and testing with lower resource requirements

## Database Structure

The platform uses multiple database systems:

1. **SQLite Databases**:
   - Word Groups API: Stores words, translations, and group metadata
   - Language Portal: Stores user progress, study sessions, and activity data

2. **Vector Store (ChromaDB)**:
   - Used by the Listening Practice module for semantic search
   - Enables finding similar questions for context-aware generation

3. **File Storage**:
   - Audio files from the Listening Practice module
   - Configuration files across services
   - Lyrics text files from the Song Vocabulary Agent
   - Vocabulary JSON files with detailed word breakdowns

## Installation

Each service has its own installation instructions. Please refer to the individual service READMEs for detailed setup steps:

- [Word Groups API Setup](./vocab-backend/README.md)
- [Marathi Writing Practice App Setup](./writing-comp/README.md)
- [Marathi Listening Practice Setup](./listening-comp/README.md)
- [Language Portal Frontend Setup](./lang-portal/README.md)
- [Marathi Song Vocabulary Agent Setup](./song-vocab/README.md)

## Usage

After installing all services, you can access the main Language Portal Frontend which provides navigation to all other modules. The typical user journey includes:

1. Selecting words to study from the Word Groups interface
2. Practicing writing and translation with the Marathi Practice App
3. Developing listening skills with the Listening Practice module
4. Finding and studying vocabulary from Marathi songs with the Song Vocabulary Agent
5. Tracking progress and managing study sessions via the Dashboard

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (for backend services)
- Node.js 14+ (for frontend applications)
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Google Cloud account with Text-to-Speech API enabled
- ffmpeg (for audio processing)
- Ollama (optional, for local LLM processing)

### Running the Development Environment
Follow the setup instructions for each individual service and run them simultaneously.

## Future Extensions

The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new language learning features, such as:
- Speech recognition and pronunciation practice
- Grammar exercises and explanations
- Cultural context and language immersion activities
- Mobile application support
- Multi-language support beyond Marathi
- Expanded song library and automatic difficulty grading
