    Considerations and Next Steps:
    * This sentence uses "therefore" as a connection between two ideas
    * In Marathi, we often use म्हणून (mhanun) to show cause and effect
    * The first part describes a state (being cold) in a location
    * The second part describes an action that needs to be done
    * Consider how to express "need to" in Marathi - this is often done with पाहिजे
    * The word order will be different from English, with the verb coming at the end
    You can:

    Try forming the first part about it being cold
    Ask about how to connect two ideas with "therefore"
    Ask about how to express "need to" in Marathi
    Make an attempt at the full sentence
